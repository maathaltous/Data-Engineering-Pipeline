# Data-Engineering-Pipeline
Data Pipeline Automation with MYSQL, Python, and AWS
This project was about exploring the field of Data Engineering through a real-life business case.

A scooter-sharing company is planning to expand to the biggest cities in Europe. The idea is to have, in each city, scooters ready at the most important hotspots (train stations, airports) and around the city center, so that customers wonâ€™t have to wait or walk too long to start their ride. In order to be successful, we will have to predict when and where the cars will be more needed.

The objective of this project was to accomplish the following steps:

Data Collection: collect the data through web-scraping or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
Data Storage: create a Database (MySQL in my case) and store the gathered data there
Pipeline to the Cloud: use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to move the pipeline to the cloud
Pipeline Automation: automate the whole data collection and storage process
